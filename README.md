1. Does the page look the same as it looks when running on your local computer? If not, why not? What can you do to fix it? answer: no they do not look the same. on the server the videos load fine but on my local device the video boxes are appearing but no displaying the video, and are not playable from the website. I have no clue how to fix this or what is going on. i tried with several other videos but the same thing kept happening.
1. Use git to stage your changes, commit your changes, and push your changes to your remote repository.
1. Tell your repository to deploy to github pages (see the screenshot and caption below it in the `figure` in `index.html`)
1. Does the page look the same as it looks when running on your local computer? If not, why not? What can you do to fix it? answer: no it does not. the iframe embedded videos are not showing at all. I don't know exactly why this is but I know it has to do with the protocol because if you remove https: from the source of the iframe it works fine.
